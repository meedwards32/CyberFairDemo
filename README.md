## Overview
This project is part of the first annual **CMU Cyber Fair**. The demonstration simulates an attack vector to raise awareness about common cybersecurity risks and online safety.

### Purpose:
The aim is to highlight vulnerabilities in user behavior, specifically targeting individuals with a low technological IQ, and demonstrate how attackers exploit these gaps.

## Key Details:
- **Who**: The demonstration targets **all users**, especially those unfamiliar with safe online practices.
- **What**: 
  - The project includes a **frontend HTML page** that mimics Google's homepage.
  - A **Python (Flask)** backend is used to handle user searches, which are saved in a `.txt` file.
- **Where**: The replicated **Google.com** interface can be accessed from any device connected to the internet.
- **Why**: 
  - To educate users about **social engineering**, **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM)** attacks, and **network traffic interception**.
  - To encourage better awareness of **online security** and checking URLs for authenticity.

## Educational Goals:
- Demonstrate how attackers can manipulate a familiar interface (e.g., Google) for malicious purposes.
- Illustrate the importance of **scrutinizing URLs** to prevent falling victim to phishing or spoofing attacks.
- Show how **search data** can be captured and misused.
